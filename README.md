# Ghost Recon - Wildlands | Desktop Resource Manager

This app is for sending resources to your game

# It's a alpha version
Alpha (heavly untested) release: https://github.com/AdrianoCahete/grw-resourcemanager/releases/

## How this works
Official mobile app Companion uses a **local API** to connect into game and send the same data. The script from [Wanztwurst](https://github.com/Wanztwurst/grw-resources) do the same thing, but without needed to wait the "Guerrilla game".

This app is just a better way to run his script locally.

## FAQ

### Can I be banned for this?
Unlikely. As already said, it's used a internal API to send resources.

### Don't work for me! What do I do? 
First, check your firewall and/or if you're inside the game properly (inside the game = you can run around).
If still don't working, please, open a [issue here](https://github.com/AdrianoCahete/grw-resourcemanager/issues).
