# grw-resources
#### Get Ghost Recon Wildlands resources on a single button press (actually two with some waiting and luck)


## What it does

Connects to your running GRW game on PC, sends your desired amount of resources, that's it.

* Select amount
* ???
* Profit


## How it works

The game opens a web server when started. This way it communicates with the GRW HQ Android application - from which you can natively send resources to your main game. Exactly this is reproduced by this web app, but without the mini game bullshit, waiting time between the resource transfers or quantitiy limits.
And because the game uses the handy WebSockets protocol, which your browser speaks as well, it can all be done from a webpage.
