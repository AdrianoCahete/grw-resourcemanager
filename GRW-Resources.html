			<h5>You are about to cheat...</h5>
			<p>
				...which is totally okay in my opinion in this coop game &ndash; at least when it comes to resources. You may find gathering them too grindy, maybe you don't like to capture all the transports &ndash; decide yourself if you need this.
				<br />
				But remember: this is a big part of the game and you are probably throwing away that nice game time you could have had.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using this tool will, if nothing goes wrong, grant you the selected amount of resources on your <strong>currently logged in save slot</strong> in Ghost Recon Wildlands.
			</p>
			<p>
				You might want to give it a second thought: <strong>there is no way back!</strong>
			</p>

			<h5>WARNING</h5>
			<p>
				This game is protected by EasyAntiCheat and maybe other things I don't know of, but I find it very unlikely to be banned or sanctioned by adding resources over an API Ubisoft themselves implemented and didn't invest a single minute in security on. I mean, it's neither encrypted nor anyhow limited on the game side - like they want us to magically create resources from some electrones.

			<h6>1. Connect to game</h6>
			<input type="text" id="ip" value="127.0.0.1" placeholder="127.0.0.1"><label>ip</label>
			<p>Use 127.0.0.1 if you opened this page on the same PC your game is running on. If it's a different device, enter corresponding ip address here (may work with consoles as well, but I don't really give a damn on you gamepad using scum).</p>

			<button onclick="stopReloading = false; connect();" id="btn_connect" style="display:inline-block">Connect to game</button><label id="ample">&nbsp;</label>
			<button onclick="stopReloading = true; location.href = 'GRW-Resources.html'" id="btn_stopReloading" style="display:none">Stop reloading</button>

			<h6>2. wait for connection</h6>
			<p>Wait for the go, see log on the right side for information regarding your connection status.<p>
			<p>If you have problems here, make sure you disabled the Windows firewall, have the game running and are logged in (read: able to run around)</p>

			<h6>3. Select amount of resources</h6>
			<input type="number" id="fuel" value="1000" /><label>Fuel</label>
			<input type="number" id="meds" value="1000" /><label>Meds</label>
			<input type="number" id="coms" value="1000" /><label>Coms</label>
			<input type="number" id="food" value="1000" /><label>Food</label>

			<h6>3. Transfer resources</h6>
			<button onclick="giveMeResources();" id="btn_giveMeRes" disabled="true">Give resources</button>

			<p>
				As of March 10, 2017 there is no limit on how many and how often you can transfer resources. You may press the button multiple times if it pleases you. <br />
				My recommendation: don't even press it once, rather group up with some nice peeps, have some drugs and fun and earn the resources yourself, lazy shit.

		Ghost Recon Wildlands&copy;&#0153; is a trademark owned by Ubisoft and what, you know the drill. I don't own any of the images or content here, all credits go to Ubisoft for creating this awesome game and graphics. Thanks Ubi! Looking forward for some super cool dlc contents.
